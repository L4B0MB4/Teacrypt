# Teacrypt

## How to use in dev:

Yarn install

Yarn start or Yarn build

Go to chrome extensions -> load unzipped files -> choose the 'dist' folder.

Go to teams. Write a message. Hit enter (currently only enter is supported).

## Concept:

There should be an overlay where you can enter a key and a name for a chat (person or group).

Based on this key and the chat name teacrypt will know which messages to de- and encrypt.

Also encrypted messaged should have a prefix to prevent plain messages to be wrongfully decrpyted.
